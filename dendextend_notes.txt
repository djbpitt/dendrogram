See although methodological notes about agglomerative clustering in general at http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63546/comparing-hierarchical-clustering-dendrograms-obtained-by-different-distances/63549#63549

To cut and separate sub-dendrograms, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18789059/r-plot-smaller-clusters-from-hclust

m is a matrix object
Create agnes object called "clusters" the old-fashioned way
agnes can treat a matrix like dissimilarities with diss=TRUE, so it can operate directly on the matrix:
agnex(m, type="complete")


library(dendextend)
library(dendextendRcpp)
# no need to load magrittr; dendextend provides %>%

# convert to dendrogram object, which has additional properties
clusters = agnex(m, type="complete")
dend = as.dendrogram(clusters)
dend %>% set("labels", labels) %>% hang.dendrogram %>% set("labels_cex", 0.2) %>% plot

or use hclust, in which case convert the matrix object to a dist object first, since otherwise it doesn't know that it's dissimilarities:
as.dendrogram(hclust(as.dist(m), method = 'complete')) %>% set("labels", labels) %>% hang.dendrogram %>% set("labels_cex", 0.2) %>% plot

This is clearer with chaining:

as.dist(m) %>% # convert matrix to dist object
hclust(method = "complete") %>% # use hclust to cluster (can't accept non-dist matrix, unlike agnes)
as.dendrogram %>% # it's possible to plot an hclust object, but better to convert to dendrogram object to make it pretty later
set("labels", labels) %>% # prepare to use labels when plotting later
hang.dendrogram %>% # hang the labels high
set("labels_cex", 0.2) %>% # make the label text small
plot # draw the plotâ€”finally!

Other stuff to do:

set("labels_col", value = c(2:6), k = 5) %>% # color the 5 partitions differently

Or (better for us), color the branches, rather than the labels, and use default colors:
set("branches_k_color", k = 3)

sort (sorts by labels; helpful for tanglegram?)

abline(h = 2, lty = 2) # draws a dashed line at height 2; must be called *after* plot()

rect.dendrogram is broken in Anaconda R (crashes kernel), works in RStudio
To color rectangles to match branches and use thin lines:

dend %>% 
  set("labels", labels) %>% 
  set("labels_cex", 0.225) %>% # make the label text small
  set("branches_k_color", k = 8, value = 1:9) %>% # number of partitions and colors
  set("branches_lwd", 0.5) %>% # thin lines
  hang.dendrogram %>% # pull labels up to lines
  plot
rect.dendrogram(dend, k = 8, lwd = 0.5, border = 1:9) # match number of partitions and colors; thin lines

Last <path> elements are the rectangles. To make them clickable (zoom in on subtree), give them a fill (anything), set the fill-opacity property to 0, and move them to the top, so that they don't mask the clickable ms identifiers. Figure out how to handle event bubbling.
